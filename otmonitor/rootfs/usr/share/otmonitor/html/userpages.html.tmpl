<h1>Custom web pages</h1>
<div>
It is possible to add your own web pages to the otmonitor web server or
override built-in pages by placing them in a direcotry called <i>html</i>
located in the same directory as the otmonitor binary.

<h2>Style sheet</h2>
To give custom pages a similar appearence as the built-in pages, the
otmonitor.css file may be used as a style sheet. That file picks up the
selected web theme.

<h2>Web theme</h2>
To create your own web theme, create a file called theme-&lt;name&gt;.css in
the <i>html</i> directory.

<h2>Web sockets</h2>
You can use websockets in your customized web pages. Currently the following
websockets are available:
<dl>
<dt>status.ws
<dd>Reports updates to the information shown on the status screen in JSON
format.
<dt>upgrade.ws
<dd>Reports the progress of a firmware update in JSON format.
<dt>message.ws
<dd>Reports every opentherm message reported by the gateway, including a
timestamp, the hex message, and a translation to human readable form.
</dl>

<h2>Commands</h2>
The special page <i>command</i> can be used to send a serial command to the
gateway. Either use a "GET" or "POST" operation, specifying the desired
command as query data. The request will return the response from the gateway.
<dl>
<dt>Example:
<dd>The request
<a href="command?PR=C">http://[dict get $header host]/command?PR=C</a>
produces: PR: C=4 MHz
</dl>
